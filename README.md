Fighting Fake News with AI!
 
 Excited to share my first Data Science project!

 I built a Fake News Detection System using Logistic Regression and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model processes news articles, applies TF-IDF vectorization, and classifies them as real or fake with strong accuracy.

 This project gave me hands-on experience with text preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying machine learning for classification. It was a great learning step and has motivated me to explore more projects in AI/ML.
